## PART 1 - How to Intrigue Everyone Without Saying a Word: You Only Have Ten Seconds to Show You’re a Somebody 

<br />

**1)How to Make Your Smile Magically Different - The Flooding smile**

Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them.

<br />

**2) How to Strike Everyone as Intelligent and Insightful by Using Your Eyes - Sticky eyes**

Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partner’s with sticky warm taffy. Don’t break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly, reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the tiny string finally breaks.

<br />

**3) How to Use Your Eyes to Make Someone Fall in Love with You - Epoxy eyes**

This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact.

<br />

**4) How to Look Like a Big Winner Wherever YouGo - Hang by your teeth**

Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position.

<br />

**5) How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their “Inner Infant” - The big-baby pivot**

Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts “I think you are very, very special.”

<br />

**6) How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once - Hello old friend**

When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicis- situdes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy mack- erel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend!
The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes—and everything between.

<br />

**7) How to Come Across as 100 Percent Credible to Everyone - Limit the fidget**

Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing.

<br />

**8) How to Read People Like You Have ESP - Hans's horse sense**

Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves accordingly.
If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got horse sense.

<br />

**9) How to Make Sure You Don’t Miss a Single Beat - Watch the scenen before you make the scene**

Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR yourself chatting comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you. VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically.

<br />

<br />

## PART 2 - How to Know What to Say After You Say “Hi”

**10) How to Start Great Small Talk - Make a good match**

Before opening your mouth, take a “voice sample” of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a “psychic photograph” of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.

<br />

**11) How to Sound Like You’ve Got a Super Personality (No Matter What You’re Saying!) - Prosaic with passion**

Worried about your first words? Fear not, because 80 percent of your listener’s impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting.

<br />

**12) How to Make People Want to Start a Conversation with You - Always wear a whatzit**

Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your . . . what IS that?”

<br />

**13) How to Meet the People *You* Want to Meet - Whoozat**

Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by non- politicians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers.

<br />

**14) How to Break into a Tight Crowd - Eavesdrop in **

No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear. . . .”
Will they be taken aback? Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily.
Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely!

<br />

**15) How to Make “Where Are You From?” Sound Exciting - Never the naked city**

Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, “And where are you from?” never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer.
Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist.

<br />

**16) How to Come Out a Winner Every Time They Ask, “And What Do You Do?” Never the naked job**

When asked the inevitable “And what do you do,” you may think “I’m an economist/an educator/an engineer” is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying “I’m a paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer.”
Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray.

<br />

**17) How to Introduce People Like the Host(ess) with the Most(est) - Never the naked introduction**

When introducing people, don’t throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity.

<br />

**18) How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation - Be a word detective**

Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partner’s every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for the other person.

<br />

**19) How to Enthrall ’Em with Your Choice of Topic—Them! - The Swiveling Spotlight**

When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it’s shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you.

<br />

**20) How to Never Need to Wonder, “What Do I Say Next?” - Parroting**

Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen.

<br />

**21) How to Get ’Em Happily Chatting (So You Can Slip Away if You Want To!) - Encore!**

The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is “Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!” The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is “Tell them about the time you . . .”
Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance.

<br />

**22) How to Come Across as a Positive Person - Ac-cen-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive**

When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to “ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.”

<br />

**23) How to Always Have Something Interesting to Say - The Latest News . . . Don’t Leave Home Without It**

The last move to make before leaving for the party— even after you’ve given yourself final approval in the mirror—is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybody’s talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when it’s surrounded by egg-on-face.

<br />

**24) How to Find Out What They Do (Without Even Asking!) - What Do You Do—NOT!**

A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the conspicuous ab- sence of the question, “What do you do?” (You deter- mine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber, a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone who’s never strolled along Easy Street.)

<br />

<br />

## PART 3 - How to Talk Like a VIP

**25) How to Know What to Say When They Ask, “What Do *You* Do?” - The Nutshell Résumé**

Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written résumé off their printers for each position they’re applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to “What do you do?” ask yourself, “What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?”
Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to work into your communications bag of tricks.

<br />

**26) How to Sound Even Smarter Than You Are - Your Personal Thesaurus**

<br />

Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements.
Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite.

**27) How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity) - Kill the Quick “Me, Too!”**

<br />

Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger.
P.S.: Don’t wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like you’re being tricky.

<br />

**28) How to Be a *“You- Firstie”* to Gain Their Respect and Affection - Comm-YOU-nication**

Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immedi- ately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into “me” terms.
When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice.

<br />

**29) How to Make Them Feel You “Don’t Smile at Just Anybody” - The Exclusive Smile**

If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confed- erate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty big players find in each new face.
If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her.ra
