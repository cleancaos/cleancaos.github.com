### Tyrannosaurus Rex

Even when I was a small boy my father used to sit me on his lap and read me from the Encyclopaedia Britannica. And we would read, say. about dinosaurs and maybe it would be talking about the brontosaurus, or the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and it would say something like:"This thing is twenty-five feet high and the head is six feet across," you see, and so he'd stop always and say: "Let's see what that means. That would mean that if he stood in our yard he would be high enough to put his head through the window, bot not quite because the head is a little bit too wide, and it would break the window as it came by."

Everything we'd read would be translated as best we could into some reality, so that I learned to do that: everything that I read I try to figure out what it really means, what it's really saying, by translating. So I used to get read the encyclopedia when I was a boy, but with translation, you see! It was very exciting and interesting to think there were animals of such magnitude, but I thought it was very very interesting, and they all died out, and at that time nobody knew why. From very early times I was interested in the question of what happened to the dinosaurs, and when I hear a new theory like Alvarez's theory about the meteor that came and so forth, it fitted into my past desire to know the answer to this mystery.

### Hard books

I had a trick when a book was hard-like the article on electrostatics in the encyclopedia, which I found difficult.

What I'd do is, I'd read the whole article, even though I had stopped understanding it after the first two or three paragraphs. I read the whole article vaguely, and then the next time I'd go through it again and get a little further, and so on, until I went all the way through, and then I'd write it in a book and when I did that it was complete. The things I would leave out were things like the calculation of the capacitance of an elliptical condenser, say, but I already knew by reading the whole article that those funny functions and complicated things didn't appear again in the article and were therefore a side issue. I always have had an instinct in reading a complicated book to know what were the **essential elements** I have to learn, and what were the applications or side issues which, if I didn't understand them, was not essential lack in understanding the whole thing.

I was always original like that-I did almost everything by myself, getting clues from books as to what was an interesting subject. Not calculus-I didn't work out calculus by myself!

### Imagine

It was my father who got me into this business of having to imagine things all the time. He would start out by supposing we were Martians who came here, didn't know anything, and had to figure out all about it. Things like "Why does everyone go to sleep every night?"

I don't know why it is that some people find science dull and difficult, and other people find it fun and easy, but there's one characteristic that I get a big kick from, and that is that it takes so much imagination to try to figure out what the world is really like. I find myself trying to imagine all kinds of things, all the time, and just like a runners gets a kick out of sweating, I get a kick out of thinking about these things.

I don't want you to take this stuff too seriously. I think we should just have fun imagining it, and not worry about it-there's no teacher going to ask you questions at the end!

## Key to science

In general, we look for a new law by the following process.

First, we guess...No! Don't laugh-it's really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see if this law that we guessed is right-what it would imply. Then we compare those computation results to nature-or, we say, to experiment, or experience-we compare it directly with observation to see if it works. If it disagree with experiment, it's wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn't make any difference how beautiful the guess is, it doesn't make any difference how smart you are-who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagree with experiment, it's wrong. That's all there is to it.

### The gods are playing

One way that's kind of a fun analogy in trying to get some idea of what we're doing in trying to understand nature is to imagine that gods are playing some great game, like chess, say. You don't know the rules of the game, but you're allowed to look at the board, at least from time to time, at a little corner perhaps. From these observations you try to figure out what the rules are of the game, the rules for how the pieces move.

You might discover after a bit, for example, that when there's only one bishop around on the board that the bishop maintains its color. Later on you might discover the rule for the bishop that it moves on the diagonal, which would explain the one that you understood before that it maintains its color. That would be analogous for how we discover one law and then later we find a deeper understanding of it. But things can happen: you've got all the laws, everything's going good, and then all of a sudden some strange phenomenon occurs in some corner so you begin to investigate it. It's "castling", something you didn't expect.

There can be revolutions in physics: after you've noticed that bishops maintain their color, and they go along the diagonals, and so on, for such a long time that everybody knows that's true, then you suddenly discover one day, in some chess game, that the bishop has changed color! Only later do you discover a new possibility-that a bishop was captured and that a pawn went all the way down to the other end to produce a new bishop. That can happen, but you didn't know it. That's very analogous to the ways our laws are-they look positive, they keep on working, and all of a sudden some little gimmick shows they're wrong, and then we have to investigate, and learn the new rule that explains it more deeply.

In the case of the chess game, however, the rules become more complicated as you go along; in the physics, it can get simpler. When you discover new things, new particles and so on, it appears more complicated; but what's kind of wonderful is that as we expand our experience into wilder regions, every once in a while we have these integrations, when everything's pulled together into a unification which turns out to be simpler than it looked before.

### It doesn't frighten me

You see, I can live with doubt, and uncertainty, and not knowing. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing that to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers, and possible beliefs, and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything. There are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask "Why are we here?" I might think about it a little bit, and if I can't figure it out then I'll go on to something else. But I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without having any purpose-which is the way it is, so far as i can tell. Possibly. It doesn't frighten me.

### He came to the earth!

I could say that my religion position might have nothing to do with my scientific knowledge-I have not, by learning about the physical world, directly discovered that some religious view is wrong. But I do think there is a relationship, and the relationship looks to me something like this:

The religion that I was related to, like Jewish or Christian religions, have a direct personal connection with the Creator of the universe, and in the Christian religion there is even a messenger that comes to earth because they are particularly interested in the problems of human beings.

But as you learn about the universe, that it's so vast, and that there was such long time in which there were no people, that there's such a big region in which there are other humans, and so many stars, such an intricacy of nature, and so on-well, it looks like human beings are just part of the grand nature. The stage is so huge, and the drama so effective, that i can't believe that God spends His time attending to this little corner.

I see humans as animals that have evolved to this particular point. There are very remarkable mysteries about the fact that we're able to do so many more things than animals can apparently do, and other questions like that, but these are mysteries I want to investigate without knowing the answer to them. So I can't believe those special stories that have been made up about our relationship to the universe at large, because they seem to be too simple, too local, too provincial: "He came to the earth"-one of the aspect of God came to *the earth*, mind you, and look at what's out there! It isn't in proportion. Anyway, it's no use arguing. I'm just trying to tell you why the scientific views that i have do have some effect on my beliefs.

### It's so degrading

How does the mind works? The mind is what the brain does. The brain is hundred of computers that have evolved for five hundred million years. It's a wonderful natural phenomenon, and we have to understand how this thing works. We must sweep aside the idea that the mind is animated by a soul, and the idea of a spirit or anything like that. In fact my view is that there is something insulting and degrading about the idea of a soul, and the idea of a spirit. Look at what the animals did-four hundred million years ago there were fish. Billions of fish had to live and die by Darwinian evolution. Then there were the amphibian, and the reptiles, and then mammals. It's a tremendous struggle, like nothing in human history-a struggle of trillions and trillions of these animals living and dying to develop the little changes in the circuits. Now here you are, a person, and thirty thousand genes or more are working to make the brain, the most complicated organ. If you were to say it's just a spirit, just a soul, just a little hard  diamond-like point with no structure, a gift from some creator, it's degrading! It means all the sacrifice by all of our animal ancestors is ignored. It seems to me that the religious view is the opposite of self-respect and understanding. It's taking this brain, with a hundred billion neurons, and not using it. What a paradoxical thing to be taught to do!

### Spread me around

I think that with any other person I would have made up something about what was the matter, but with Richard it seemed natural just to say, "I'm sad because I'm realizing that you're about to die."

Richard said, "Yeah, that bugs me too, sometimes."

But then he said something wish I wish I could remember exactly. It was to the effect of, "Yeah, it bugs me, but it doesn't bug me as much as you think it would, because I feel like I've told enough stories to other people, and enough of me is inside their minds. I've kind of spread me around all over the place. So I'm probably not going to go away completely when I'm dead!"
