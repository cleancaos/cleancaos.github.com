##<center>CHAPTER 1 - AMBIGUITY IN MATHEMATICS</center>
#####Ambiguity involves a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference.

#####A good equation is not simple a formula for computation. Nor is it a balance scale confirming that two items you suspected were nearly equal really are the same. Instead, scientists started using the = symbol as something of a telescope for new ideas—-a device for directing attention to fresh, unsuspected realms. Equations simply happen to be written in symbols instead of words.

#####There are two primordial sources of mathematics: counting, which leads to arithmetic and algebra, and measuring, which leads to geometry. 

#####Understanding requires more than accepting the validity of a certain argument. It requires a creative act, which is what I mean when I refer to the resolution of an ambiguity.

#####A conjecture is a “proposition that has not been proven, but is favored by some serious evidence.”

#####Logic is a form of thinking that conveys power and control that mathematicians use to considerable effect in the classroom, in conversations with one another, and even in their personal lives.
