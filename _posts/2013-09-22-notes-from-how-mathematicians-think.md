##<center>CHAPTER 1 - AMBIGUITY IN MATHEMATICS</center>
**Ambiguity** involves a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference.

>A good equation is not simple a formula for computation. Nor is it a balance scale confirming that two items you suspected were nearly equal really are the same. Instead, scientists started using the = symbol as something of a telescope for new ideas—-a device for directing attention to fresh, unsuspected realms. Equations simply happen to be written in symbols instead of words.

There are two primordial sources of mathematics: **counting**, which leads to arithmetic and algebra, and **measuring**, which leads to geometry. 

**Understanding** requires more than accepting the validity of a certain argument. It requires a creative act, which is what I mean when I refer to the resolution of an ambiguity.

A **conjecture** is a “proposition that has not been proven, but is favored by some serious evidence.”

**Logic** is a form of thinking that conveys power and control that mathematicians use to considerable effect in the classroom, in conversations with one another, and even in their personal lives.

A **metaphor** is a mapping from one cognitive domain to another. A meta- phor is a mapping from one cognitive domain to another. Metaphor, in this view, is literally what “brings abstractconcepts into being.” To put this in another way, **abstract concepts are metaphors**. This is crucial.

>“To understand a new concept I must create an appropriate met- aphor. A personification. Or a spatial metaphor. A metaphor of structure. Only then can I answer questions, solve problems. I may even be able to perform some manipulations on the con- cept. Only when I have the metaphor. Without the metaphor I just can’t do it.”

In the first place, the entire picture is really a field of black and white dots; it is this neutral field that is then interpreted as young woman/old lady. Second, each interpretation is an adequate description of the entire field of black and white dots. It is not as though some of the black and white dots are interpreted as the young woman and some as the old lady. The _entire_ field is subject to the given interpretation. Finally, the two interpretations are incompatible with one another. When you see the picture as the young woman you do not see it as the old lady. Thus both interpretations are “true” and explain everything but they are incompatible with one another. Merely saying that the picture is _both_ the old and the young woman misses the incompatibility of the two interpretations but of course saying that it is _neither_ is also missing something.
