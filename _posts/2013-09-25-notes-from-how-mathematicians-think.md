# <center>SECTION I - THE LIGHT OF AMBIGUITY</center>

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 1 - AMBIGUITY IN MATHEMATICS</center>
**Ambiguity** involves a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference.

>A good equation is not simple a formula for computation. Nor is it a balance scale confirming that two items you suspected were nearly equal really are the same. Instead, scientists started using the = symbol as something of a telescope for new ideas-a device for directing attention to fresh, unsuspected realms. Equations simply happen to be written in symbols instead of words.

There are two primordial sources of mathematics: **counting**, which leads to arithmetic and algebra, and **measuring**, which leads to geometry. 

**Understanding** requires more than accepting the validity of a certain argument. It requires a creative act, which is what I mean when I refer to the resolution of an ambiguity.

A **conjecture** is a “proposition that has not been proven, but is favored by some serious evidence.”

**Logic** is a form of thinking that conveys power and control that mathematicians use to considerable effect in the classroom, in conversations with one another, and even in their personal lives.

A **metaphor** is a mapping from one cognitive domain to another. A meta- phor is a mapping from one cognitive domain to another. Metaphor, in this view, is literally what “brings abstract concepts into being.” To put this in another way, **abstract concepts are metaphors**. This is crucial.

>“To understand a new concept I must create an appropriate metaphor. A personification. Or a spatial metaphor. A metaphor of structure. Only then can I answer questions, solve problems. I may even be able to perform some manipulations on the concept. Only when I have the metaphor. Without the metaphor I just can’t do it.”

In the first place, the entire picture is really a field of black and white dots; it is this neutral field that is then interpreted as young woman/old lady. Second, each interpretation is an adequate description of the entire field of black and white dots. It is not as though some of the black and white dots are interpreted as the young woman and some as the old lady. The _entire_ field is subject to the given interpretation. Finally, the two interpretations are incompatible with one another. When you see the picture as the young woman you do not see it as the old lady. Thus both interpretations are “true” and explain everything but they are incompatible with one another. Merely saying that the picture is _both_ the old and the young woman misses the incompatibility of the two interpretations but of course saying that it is _neither_ is also missing something.

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 3 - PARADOXES IN MATHEMATICS: INFINITY AND THE REAL NUMBERS </center>

Every ambiguous situation contains a creative potential, namely, the possible resolution of the **“incompatibility”** through the emergence of a new idea or point of view. 

Because **“infinity”** is a topic that is so obviously reaching beyond itself, its essential incompleteness never disappears from view, leaving a tension that never completely dissipate.Perhaps there was a time in the evolution of humanity when all words had this sense of open-ended incompleteness. However, today, most words have lost their magic for us by dint of endless repetition and commercial exploitation. Perhaps once “beauty” was an idea that had the power to stir the soul, but today everything and everyone is “beautiful.” So “beauty” has been debased and its magic has been lost. “Infinity” has not yet suffered that fate.

**“Is π normal?”** Normal means that its digits are truly random, at least in the sense of being uniformly distrib- uted. That is, for a number to be normal (in normal base 10 notation) each digit from 0 to 9 would appear 1/10 of the time; each sequence of two digits from 00 to 99 would appear 1/100 of the time; and so on. The answer to the question of whether π is normal seems beyond our grasp at the present time.

>What characterizes man is not only his ability to develop words and symbols, but also his being compelled to draw a distinction between what is utterable and the unutterable, to be stunned by what is but what cannot be put into words. —Abraham Heschel

“What is but cannot be put into words” could well be a descrip- tion of the infinite. Thus it is, in a way, the ultimate ambiguity.

>I asserted that the deep problems of operator theory could all be solved if we knew the answer to every finite-dimensional matrix question. I still have this religion that if you knew the answer to every matrix question, somehow you could answer every operator question. But the “somehow” would require genius. The problem is not, given an operator question, to ask the same question in finite dimensions— that’s silly. The problem is—the genius is—given an infinite question to think of the right finite questions to ask. Once you thought of the right answer, then you would know the right answer to the infinite question.
>	Combinatorics, the finite case, is where the genuine, deep insight is. Generalizing, and making it infinite, is sometimes intricate and sometimes difficult, and I might even be willing to say that it’s sometimes deep, but it is nowhere as fundamental as seeing the finite structure. —Paul Halmos

The fact is that the principle of mathematical induction is an assumption that we make about the number system. We make it because it seems reasonable to do so and because it is an invaluable tool. It enables us to prove a vast array of interesting mathematical statements that we feel *must* be true.
It is interesting that the last sentence implicitly differentiates between what is true and what can be proved. Of course this is the content of the famous incompleteness theorem of Godel. Is the truth of a mathematical statement dependent on our being able to prove it? Could something be true even if we could not *in principle* prove that it is true. 


A system is said to be *closed* under a certain operation if that operation does not take you out of the system.

##<center>CHAPTER 4 - MORE PARADOXES OF INFINITY: GEOMETRY, CARDINALITY, AND BEYOND</center>

{% highlight text %}To see the world in a grain of sand, 
And heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand 
And eternity in an hour.{% endhighlight %}

Countable infinity is the cardinality of the counting numbers. It is usually represented by the symbol א 0, aleph null. 

The paradoxes of the past have become the *epistemological obstacles* that students face in the present.

>*Proposition*: All finite intervals regardless of length have the same cardinality.

Mathematics is the science of the infinite—the infinite more than anything else is what characterizes mathematics and defines its essence. If the infinite is impossible in the sense that it is inevitably accompanied by the paradoxical, then the same holds for mathematics. This does not detract from the importance of mathematics. On the contrary, it is what makes mathematics great! To grapple with infinity is one of the bravest and extraordinary endeavors that human beings have ever undertaken.

# <center>SECTION II - THE LIGHT AS IDEA</center>

The creative in mathematics is ex-pressed through the birth of new ideas. These ideas may consist of a new way of thinking about a familiar concept or they may involve the development of an entirely novel concept. An idea is usually at the heart of a mathematical argument but an idea may even entail a new way of looking at a whole area of mathematics. Creativity in mathematics is inseparable from ideas, but what is the nature of these mathematical ideas and where do they come from?

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 5 - THE AS AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE</center>

What is an idea? An idea is a principle that organizes experience, in this case mathematical experience. “One” is not a number, it is an idea. “Zero” is an idea, and, as I discussed earlier, it is a subtle and powerful idea. Axioms are ideas that imply other ideas. There is no logical hierarchy of ideas—logic itself is an idea.

As in poetry so in mathematics everything begins with this “creative germ” to which the mathematician brings life by changing the feeling of “There must be something going on here!” to “Aha! Now I see what is going on here.”

The mathematician’s work can be broken down into various stages. The first involves spade work: collecting data and observations, performing calculations, or otherwise familiarizing oneself with a certain body of mathematical phenomena. Then there are the first inklings that there exists in this situation a pattern or regularity—something that is going on. This is followed by the hard work of bringing the embryo into fruition. Then, finally, when the idea has appeared, there is the stage of verification or proof. Is the idea in fact correct? However, this verification stage is really part of a larger and more elaborate process that involves the exploration of the full range of applicability of the idea. The latter stage may involve the abstraction or generalization of the initial idea. In practice, “writing things up” often sets the stage for the modification of the idea or, in fact, for the emergence of a new idea.

Remember that reification arises when a process “becomes” an object, such as when we write a number as an infinite decimal, for example, 1/3 = .333. . ., and think of this situation as one ambiguous process/object. It is now possible to work with this new entity and to embed it into a more general system or process. In this way a complex, potentially infinite situation has been transformed into something that can be conceptualized and worked with as a single mathematical unit.

The successful mathematical thinker does not carry around in his head all possible detail, but only works with the ideas at an “appropriate” level. The unsuccessful thinker is unable to recognize what level is appropriate to the given situation and so often gets bogged down in irrelevant detail. For example, to be successful in arithmetic, a child must learn to deal with multiplication as something in its own right and not only as repeated addition. In other words, what is happening here is that the “idea as organizing principle” becomes the “idea as thinkable entity.” Without such a mechanism for the compression of knowledge, it would not be possible to work with the extremely complex structures that make up advanced mathematics.

>What the mathematician does is examine abstract “patterns”—numerical patterns, patterns of shape, patterns of motion, patterns of behavior, voting patterns in a population, patterns of repeating chance events, and so on. Those patterns can be either real or imagined, visual or mental, static or dynamic, qualitative or quantitative, purely utilitarian or of little more than recreational interest. They can arise from the world around us, from the depths of space and time or from the workings of the human mind. Different kinds of patterns give rise to different branches of mathematics.

1 = 1^2,

1 + 3 = 4 = 2^2,

1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3^2,

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4^2.

![alt text](/img/2013-09-25/pattern.jpg "pattern")

When we have isolated “what is really going on” we would then proceed to apply that principle as widely as our imaginations and knowledge will allow. I conclude that mathematics is not merely a body of facts arranged and justified by a stringent logical structure. The logical structure of mathematics gives theorems their stability, but when we remove logic as the focal point of mathematics and replace it by the “idea” we see that the seeming stability of mathematics is not absolute.


<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 6 - IDEAS, LOGIC, AND PARADOX</center>

<br />

“Basically, I’m not interested in doing research and I never have been. I’m interested in *understanding*, which is quite a different thing.”

“When the idea is clear, the formal setup is usually unnecessary and redundant. I often feel that I could write it out myself more easily than figuring out what the authors actually wrote.” When we think about the origins and na- ture of mathematical thought we must move upstream, past the formal proofs, past the axioms, into the realm of the mathemati- cal idea. When we enter this realm we encounter a mathematics that looks very different from the mathematics we learned about in school. For one thing, it has lost the quality of absolute neces- sity though not the quality of truth.

Ideas are organizing principles, but what are being organized are other ideas. Mathematics involves ideas organizing ideas in an iterative process that can attain incredible complexity. The ideas that are organized may be processes reified as mathemati- cal objects. In fact if one goes back to the Pythagoreans, for example, one sees how complex and multidimensional were their ideas about what to us are the simplest mathematical objects— the integers one to ten.

“theories are insights which are neither true nor false, but, rather, clear in certain domains, and unclear when extended beyond those domains.”

Goro Shimura once said of his late colleague Yutaka Taniyama, “He was gifted with the special capability of making many mistakes, mostly in the right direction. I envied him for this and tried in vain to imitate him, but found it quite difficult to make good mistakes.”7 A mistake is “good” precisely because it carries within it a legitimate mathematical idea.

**Usually one proceeds from the idea to the logical structure, not from the logical structure to the idea.**

Logic itself, as I said above, is an idea, an extremely powerful organizing principle. It is connected to the notions of rationality and reason. In fact logic is the form in which reason appears in our scientific civilization. Thus logic is a prime example of the creativity of a profound idea and the ability of such an idea to literally change the world. However, we must distinguish between logic as an idea and *the use of logical argument to generate ideas*. Logical arguments do not generate ideas. As I said above, logic organizes, stabilizes and communicates ideas but the idea exists prior to the logical formulation.

Thus ideas arise out of situations that we have called ambiguous. They do not arise out of logical deduction. The logical phase comes after the idea has been formulated and now must be verified, stabilized, refined, and communicated to others.

 Go ̈del’s result puts intrinsic limitations on the reach of deductive systems; that is, it shows that given any (sufficiently complex) deductive system, there are results that are beyond the reach of the system—results that are true but cannot be proved or disproved on the basis of the initial set of axioms. This new result might be proved by adding new axioms to the system (for example, the result itself) but the new strengthened system will itself have unprovable results.

 >Godel’s incompleteness proof is very clever. It’s very paradoxical. It almost looks crazy. Godel starts in effect with the paradox of the liar: the statement “I’m false!” which is neither true nor false. Actually what Godel does is to construct a statement that says of itself, “I’m unprovable!” Now if you can construct such a statement. . . in arithmetic. . . you’re in trouble. Why? Because if that statement is provable, it is by necessity false, and you’re proving false results. If it’s unprovable, as it says of itself, then its true, and mathematics is incomplete.

##<center>CHAPTER 7 - GREAT IDEAS</center>

<br />

>It is in this place, the place of crisis, close to the impossible and the contradictory, that we will find the living heart of the mathematical enterprise.

Great ideas are wrong but they are wrong in a brilliant and inspired way. Many of the seminal advances in mathematics and science are “wrong” in this sense.

Mathematics is about “pattern.” Ran- domness is the absence of pattern. Mathematics studies randomness.

If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is one in a thousand has a false positive rate of 5 percent, what is the chance that a person found to have a positive result actually has the disease?

“Chaos” is the term that is now used to indicate that simple functions when iterated (as above with T), produce complex, even random behavior.

It looks like a particle whenever we look. In between it acts like a wave. Because measured electron is radically different from unmeasured electron, it appears that we cannot describe this quon (or any other) as it is without referring to the act of observation. If we ignore observations for the moment, we might be tempted to say that an electron is all wave, since this is how it behaves when it’s not looked at. However this description ignores the massive fact that every observation shows nothing but little particles—only their patterns are wavelike. If we say, on the other hand that between measurements the electron is really a particle, we can’t explain the quantum facts. How does each electron on its own know how to find its place in the (wavelike) Airy pattern? What does a single electron “interfere with” to produce Airy’s dark rings?

# <center>SECTION III - THE LIGHT AND THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER</center>

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 8 - THE TRUTH OF MATHEMATICS</center>

<br />

Mathematics is a way of using the mind with the goal of knowing the truth, that is, of obtaining certainty.

For most mathematicians, the idea is the deepest level. It is “what is really going on.” In Chapter 5 mathematical ideas were discussed in their role as “organizing principles.” They organize mathematical situations by revealing relationships that would otherwise be hidden. A mathematical idea is an insight into a relationship between mathematical objects and procedures, a pattern within a mathematical domain.7 The certainty that we feel when we become conscious of a mathematical idea arises at the same time as the idea. The formal proof then becomes a way of objectifying and communicating this certainty. Perhaps the “truth” of the mathematical situation is accessed by means of the mathematical idea.

>An obvious feature of the ordinary world is that it seems to be made of objects. An object is an entity that produces different images from different points of view. . . but all these images can be thought of as being produced by one central cause. . . . Its division into objects is a most important aspect of the everyday world. But the situation is different in the quantum world. . . .
The separate worlds that we form of the quantum world (wave, particle, for example) from different experimental viewpoints do not combine into one comprehensive whole. There is no single image that corresponds to an electron. The quantum world is not made up of objects. As Heisenberg put it, “Atoms are not things.”
This does not mean that the quantum world is subjective. The quantum world is as objective as our own: different people taking the same viewpoint see the same thing, but the quantum world is not made of objects (different viewpoints do not add up). The quantum world is objective but objectless.
An example of a phenomenon which is objective but not an object is the rainbow. A rainbow has no end because the rainbow is not a “thing.” A rainbow appears in a different place for each observer—in fact each of your eyes sees a slightly different rainbow. Yet the rainbow is an objective phenomenon; it can be photographed.

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 9 - IS MATHEMATIC ALGORITHMIC OR CREATIVE?</center>

<br />

Depth resides in ambiguity but only when the situation is resolved by an act of creativity. 

I claim that there is something that is going on in mathemati- cal thought that is nontrivial. What is this other factor? Mathematics is deep; mathematics is basically a creative activity; math- ematics is one of the most profound ways of using the mind. Much of this book has been an attempt to get a handle on what it means for a piece of mathematics to be “deep.” In a sense the entire book is a discussion of the distinction between the “trivial” and the “nontrivial” within mathematical thought. The question of distinguishing between “depth” and “triviality” is vital! Is profundity a matter of quality or quantity? The propo- nents of artificial intelligence might argue that it is one of quan- tity and that the advent of bigger and faster machines will make all of human thought accessible to machine replication. I maintain that the difference is qualitative.

“Technical skill is the mastery of complexity, while creativity is mastery of simplicity.”

One of the aspects of a living system is that it is creative. Life is continually being confronted with problems and the necessity to resolve these problems. Problems, in life, in art, and in science, are inevitable. Not only can they not be avoided but they are the very things that spur development, that spur evolution. The solutions that these problematic situations bring forth are unpredictable, a priori. The solution to such problems often involves an element that is entirely unexpected—the creative element. A creative solution is not mechanical—it does not involve juggling a number of predetermined elements according to predeter- mined rules. It involves the emergence of a novel way of looking at the original situation. This new way of seeing is often generated by very incompatible tendencies within the original situation that made it problematic in the first place. This is the essence of a living system as it is the essence of mathematics. This living essence is intimately connected to what I have been calling “the light of ambiguity.” The essence of mathematics is that it is nontrivial, creative, and alive.
