# <center>SECTION I - THE LIGHT OF AMBIGUITY</center>

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 1 - AMBIGUITY IN MATHEMATICS</center>
**Ambiguity** involves a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference.

>A good equation is not simple a formula for computation. Nor is it a balance scale confirming that two items you suspected were nearly equal really are the same. Instead, scientists started using the = symbol as something of a telescope for new ideas-a device for directing attention to fresh, unsuspected realms. Equations simply happen to be written in symbols instead of words.

There are two primordial sources of mathematics: **counting**, which leads to arithmetic and algebra, and **measuring**, which leads to geometry. 

**Understanding** requires more than accepting the validity of a certain argument. It requires a creative act, which is what I mean when I refer to the resolution of an ambiguity.

A **conjecture** is a “proposition that has not been proven, but is favored by some serious evidence.”

**Logic** is a form of thinking that conveys power and control that mathematicians use to considerable effect in the classroom, in conversations with one another, and even in their personal lives.

A **metaphor** is a mapping from one cognitive domain to another. A meta- phor is a mapping from one cognitive domain to another. Metaphor, in this view, is literally what “brings abstract concepts into being.” To put this in another way, **abstract concepts are metaphors**. This is crucial.

>“To understand a new concept I must create an appropriate metaphor. A personification. Or a spatial metaphor. A metaphor of structure. Only then can I answer questions, solve problems. I may even be able to perform some manipulations on the concept. Only when I have the metaphor. Without the metaphor I just can’t do it.”

In the first place, the entire picture is really a field of black and white dots; it is this neutral field that is then interpreted as young woman/old lady. Second, each interpretation is an adequate description of the entire field of black and white dots. It is not as though some of the black and white dots are interpreted as the young woman and some as the old lady. The _entire_ field is subject to the given interpretation. Finally, the two interpretations are incompatible with one another. When you see the picture as the young woman you do not see it as the old lady. Thus both interpretations are “true” and explain everything but they are incompatible with one another. Merely saying that the picture is _both_ the old and the young woman misses the incompatibility of the two interpretations but of course saying that it is _neither_ is also missing something.

##<center>CHAPTER 3 - PARADOXES IN MATHEMATICS: INFINITY AND THE REAL NUMBERS </center>

Every ambiguous situation contains a creative potential, namely, the possible resolution of the **“incompatibility”** through the emergence of a new idea or point of view. 

Because **“infinity”** is a topic that is so obviously reaching beyond itself, its essential incompleteness never disappears from view, leaving a tension that never completely dissipate.Perhaps there was a time in the evolution of humanity when all words had this sense of open-ended incompleteness. However, today, most words have lost their magic for us by dint of endless repetition and commercial exploitation. Perhaps once “beauty” was an idea that had the power to stir the soul, but today everything and everyone is “beautiful.” So “beauty” has been debased and its magic has been lost. “Infinity” has not yet suffered that fate.

**“Is π normal?”** Normal means that its digits are truly random, at least in the sense of being uniformly distrib- uted. That is, for a number to be normal (in normal base 10 notation) each digit from 0 to 9 would appear 1/10 of the time; each sequence of two digits from 00 to 99 would appear 1/100 of the time; and so on. The answer to the question of whether π is normal seems beyond our grasp at the present time.

>What characterizes man is not only his ability to develop words and symbols, but also his being compelled to draw a distinction between what is utterable and the unutterable, to be stunned by what is but what cannot be put into words. —Abraham Heschel

“What is but cannot be put into words” could well be a descrip- tion of the infinite. Thus it is, in a way, the ultimate ambiguity.

>I asserted that the deep problems of operator theory could all be solved if we knew the answer to every finite-dimensional matrix question. I still have this religion that if you knew the answer to every matrix question, somehow you could answer every operator question. But the “somehow” would require genius. The problem is not, given an operator question, to ask the same question in finite dimensions— that’s silly. The problem is—the genius is—given an infinite question to think of the right finite questions to ask. Once you thought of the right answer, then you would know the right answer to the infinite question.
>	Combinatorics, the finite case, is where the genuine, deep insight is. Generalizing, and making it infinite, is sometimes intricate and sometimes difficult, and I might even be willing to say that it’s sometimes deep, but it is nowhere as fundamental as seeing the finite structure. —Paul Halmos

The fact is that the principle of mathematical induction is an assumption that we make about the number system. We make it because it seems reasonable to do so and because it is an invaluable tool. It enables us to prove a vast array of interesting mathematical statements that we feel *must* be true.
It is interesting that the last sentence implicitly differentiates between what is true and what can be proved. Of course this is the content of the famous incompleteness theorem of Godel. Is the truth of a mathematical statement dependent on our being able to prove it? Could something be true even if we could not *in principle* prove that it is true. 


A system is said to be *closed* under a certain operation if that operation does not take you out of the system.

##<center>CHAPTER 4 - MORE PARADOXES OF INFINITY: GEOMETRY, CARDINALITY, AND BEYOND</center>

{% highlight text %}To see the world in a grain of sand, 
And heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand 
And eternity in an hour.{% endhighlight %}

Countable infinity is the cardinality of the counting numbers. It is usually represented by the symbol א 0, aleph null. 

The paradoxes of the past have become the *epistemological obstacles* that students face in the present.

>*Proposition*: All finite intervals regardless of length have the same cardinality.

Mathematics is the science of the infinite—the infinite more than anything else is what characterizes mathematics and defines its essence. If the infinite is impossible in the sense that it is inevitably accompanied by the paradoxical, then the same holds for mathematics. This does not detract from the importance of mathematics. On the contrary, it is what makes mathematics great! To grapple with infinity is one of the bravest and extraordinary endeavors that human beings have ever undertaken.

# <center>SECTION II - THE LIGHT AS IDEA</center>

The creative in mathematics is ex-pressed through the birth of new ideas. These ideas may consist of a new way of thinking about a familiar concept or they may involve the development of an entirely novel concept. An idea is usually at the heart of a mathematical argument but an idea may even entail a new way of looking at a whole area of mathematics. Creativity in mathematics is inseparable from ideas, but what is the nature of these mathematical ideas and where do they come from?

<br />

##<center>CHAPTER 5 - THE AS AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE</center>

What is an idea? An idea is a principle that organizes experience, in this case mathematical experience. “One” is not a number, it is an idea. “Zero” is an idea, and, as I discussed earlier, it is a subtle and powerful idea. Axioms are ideas that imply other ideas. There is no logical hierarchy of ideas—logic itself is an idea.

As in poetry so in mathematics everything begins with this “creative germ” to which the mathematician brings life by changing the feeling of “There must be something going on here!” to “Aha! Now I see what is going on here.”

The mathematician’s work can be broken down into various stages. The first involves spade work: collecting data and observations, performing calculations, or otherwise familiarizing oneself with a certain body of mathematical phenomena. Then there are the first inklings that there exists in this situation a pattern or regularity—something that is going on. This is followed by the hard work of bringing the embryo into fruition. Then, finally, when the idea has appeared, there is the stage of verification or proof. Is the idea in fact correct? However, this verification stage is really part of a larger and more elaborate process that involves the exploration of the full range of applicability of the idea. The latter stage may involve the abstraction or generalization of the initial idea. In practice, “writing things up” often sets the stage for the modification of the idea or, in fact, for the emergence of a new idea.

Remember that reification arises when a process “becomes” an object, such as when we write a number as an infinite decimal, for example, 1/3 = .333. . ., and think of this situation as one ambiguous process/object. It is now possible to work with this new entity and to embed it into a more general system or process. In this way a complex, potentially infinite situation has been transformed into something that can be conceptualized and worked with as a single mathematical unit.

The successful mathematical thinker does not carry around in his head all possible detail, but only works with the ideas at an “appropriate” level. The unsuccessful thinker is unable to recognize what level is appropriate to the given situation and so often gets bogged down in irrelevant detail. For example, to be successful in arithmetic, a child must learn to deal with multiplication as something in its own right and not only as repeated addition. In other words, what is happening here is that the “idea as organizing principle” becomes the “idea as thinkable entity.” Without such a mechanism for the compression of knowledge, it would not be possible to work with the extremely complex structures that make up advanced mathematics.

>What the mathematician does is examine abstract “patterns”—numerical patterns, patterns of shape, patterns of motion, patterns of behavior, voting patterns in a population, patterns of repeating chance events, and so on. Those patterns can be either real or imagined, visual or mental, static or dynamic, qualitative or quantitative, purely utilitarian or of little more than recreational interest. They can arise from the world around us, from the depths of space and time or from the workings of the human mind. Different kinds of patterns give rise to different branches of mathematics.

1 = 1^2,

1 + 3 = 4 = 2^2,

1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3^2,

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4^2.
